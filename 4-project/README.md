### I made this to lear how to use passport with sessions storage in nestjs

The user that can you log is

```json
     {
      "username": "Alice"',
      "password": "pass"',
     },
     {
       "username": "Bob",
       "password": "pass",
     }
```

you can see it better in `src/users/users.service.ts`

this run in your `localhost:3000`

you can log and logout see the pets of alice and bob
